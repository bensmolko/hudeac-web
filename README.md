# hudeac-web

This project is a Django web application that I created for my club, the Environmental Awareness Club of Hudson High School. This website contains a photo gallery(though I believe all photos are only from about 4 of our volunteer events), an air quality tracker, a mission statement page, and a mailing list form. By using the Django web framework, I put myself in control of nearly all aspects of the website -- from static file loading to database administration. My primary goal for starting this website was to spread the message of our club and get more underclassmen to join, which has come to fruition. I also wanted to gain more technical experience. One of the updates I've made to this website was the addition of the air quality discord bot functionality. I gained experience in JavaScript by converting the Python scripts for the discord bot into JavaScript and deploying them to the website.
